## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
    - It has PegSolitaireDemo.java file which contains main function to demo.

- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
    - It has both interface and implementation classes. 

- `doc`: the folder to maintain all documents about the program

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

- The program will be work with JRE JDK 11 and JavaFX SDK 11 best.
